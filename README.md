##Bankaccount
===
This script is derived from the last exercise of the Ruby tutorial on http://www.codeacademy.com !

Basically itÂ´s just a script where you can enter a name, password, go into an 'account' add money, withdraw money and so on. 

Very basic, just me playing around sending information around between methods and classes.
